This establishes loading through the installed debugger, a native read of one
byte at guest physical address zero, and cleanup in that run. Host PID 11068 is
historical; runners discover the current PID. The returned plug-in identity is
`VBoxDbgHeadAimBridge`, which the runner already uses for unloading.

The following remain unverified: arbitrary game-memory reads, guest process
page-table discovery, virtual-to-physical translation for Free Fire, entity/head/
visibility layouts, aim-control writes, repeated runs and concurrent shutdown.
No player coordinates or working aim-lock were demonstrated by this test.

## Next prerequisite collection

`Get-GuestMappingContext.ps1` records the live kernel version, available kernel
layout sources, a short allowlist of kernel symbols, game PID, physical RAM
ranges, paging mode, and per-CPU paging registers. It verifies the same host VMM
build and releases its shared session in `finally`. It uses ADB at the explicit
device serial; keep the corresponding Pie64 instance and Free Fire running.

It does not load the bridge, write guest memory, pause the VM, or change settings.
It does not retry the unavailable COM memory readers or `/proc/<game>/maps`.
CPU register reads are separate scheduling samples: a CR3 value must not be
assumed to belong to Free Fire. Zero kernel-symbol addresses are redacted, and
unavailable BTF/config/symbol sources are observations, not usable layouts.

The reference Oracle 6.1.36 Linux digger's `dbgDiggerLinuxQueryInterface` returns
only the DMESG interface. PROCESS and THREAD enum names alone do not provide an
implemented process mapper. The BlueStacks fork's support for a process mapper
has not been established.

The collector requires a Windows runtime check. Its report determines which
kernel layout and page-table discovery path can actually be implemented next;
it does not establish game mappings by itself.

Cloud checks using checksum-verified PowerShell 7.4.6 passed: syntax parsing,
continuation after an unavailable query, and rejection of a non-Windows host
with a partial report and exit code 1. These do not validate Windows COM, ADB,
or the actual guest queries.
